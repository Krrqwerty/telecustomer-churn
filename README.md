# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn and to build a model that can predict which customers are likely to leave. By analyzing churn patterns, the company can make informed decisions to improve customer retention.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, especially in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. This project uses a machine learning approach to predict churn by analyzing customer demographic and usage data. This model can help businesses target at-risk customers with retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on customer demographics, account details, service usage, and whether the customer churned (1 for churn, 0 for retention). The dataset includes features such as:

- **Customer demographics:** Gender, age, etc.
- **Account information:** Contract type, tenure, payment method
- **Service usage:** Monthly charges, total charges, types of services subscribed
- **Churn Label:** Whether the customer churned or retained

Please ensure the dataset is in the correct directory and named appropriately if running this notebook.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:** Ensure the following libraries are installed:

  ```bash
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  scikit-learn
  ```

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telco-customer-churn.git
   cd telco-customer-churn
   ```

2. Place the dataset file (if not included in the repository) in the project directory.

3. Install the required Python packages as outlined above.

## Usage

Run the notebook to explore the data and train a churn prediction model:

```bash
jupyter notebook "telco-customer-churn.ipynb"
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to analyze the data, visualize patterns, and train machine learning models for churn prediction.
